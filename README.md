# Software Releases Helper

Simple util that allows to automate some actions for software releases.

At the moment, it can automate:
- Git merge operations
- Jenkins builds startup

Actions are grouped by category and project, with multiple-selection and chaining options.

See [application-sample.yml](https://github.com/Simone3/SoftwareReleasesHelper/blob/main/src/main/resources/application-sample.yml) for a configuration example.
